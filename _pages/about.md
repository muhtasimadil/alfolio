Hi! This is Muhtasim Ahmed Adil. Some people call me "Muhtasim", some call me "Adil", some call me "Invincible". 

Currently majoring Computer Science at Brac University, BD. Hoping to graduate by 2024 with a good CGPA and some great achievements. I'm heavily interested in DeFi. 

In my middle schoool, high school days I used to participate in national level Competitive Programming contests, did a few camps. Even though competitive programming journey hasn't been fruitful for me, I met a lot of like-minded people through this and learned a lot. 

I aspire to work as a Software Engineer or a Product Manager for a good product at a good company. Before that, I want to complete a master's degree in Computer Science from a North American university. I have a slight wish to do an MBA as well. But plans are plans. They never come out as reality.

On my free time, I worry about society and don't do anything about it. I like to take long walks, occasionally run, and like to think I have a good taste in music.
